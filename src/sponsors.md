     <h4>About</h4>

    <p>NodeConf Barcelona is a one day, single track conference that gets all Node.js developers into a room for an entire day. It is an event to finally get to meet in person and is an opportunity for you to reach a strong technical audience as well as a great community of Node.js enthusiasts.</p>

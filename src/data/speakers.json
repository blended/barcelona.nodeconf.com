Every developer has fallen over the tripwire that character encodings present, and Node.js has a couple of quirks of its own. This talk will explain the involved concepts on a beginner’s level and make sure you’ll understand everything you need to know."

This talk will dive into AWS lambdas, a.k.a serverless functions and show how Node can be used to build a small application running on AWS Lambda with the help of the a new deployment model called SAM (AWS Serverless Application Model). We will also discuss testing (with Mocha and Chai) as well as moving towards purely functional javascript and some of its concepts (immutability and point-free programming)."

	"abstract": "Node.js is growing up, and with that comes the responsibility of proper legacy support. As of Node.js Argon (v4.2.0) there is an official Long Term Support release cycle that lasts for 30 months!\n\nHow does a project moving at the pace of node maintain multiple release lines? How does a commit get backported? How is a release actually made?\nYou will learn all this and more on this weeks episode of \"Node.js Releases, how do they work?\".\nI work as a full time Node.js contributor for IBM. Currently I am one of the individuals in the trenches back porting commits. If you are using an LTS version of node, there is a decent likely hood that I released it.\n\nRelease management is a very interesting art, and I would love the opportunity to pull the curtains back a bit on the process of how code lands into a project like node, and the kind of edge cases created when wrangling such a repo."

I'll explain why they exist, how they were created, who runs them... and how **you** can join in!"

      <h4>Our Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
        corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
      <p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
        and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
        or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces, online and offline, and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
         Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
         or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</p>
      <p>Specifically, all applicants, students, mentors, sponsors, and contributors are subject to this Code of Conduct when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>at in person trainings, events, and partner events (e.g. Node Live)</li>
        <li>when communicating with the NodeConf org, publicly, such as on Twitter, or privately, via email or form communication</li>
        <li>when contributing to projects on GitHub, via issues, PRs or comments</li>
        <li>when speaking about NodeConf at a public event, such as a conference or user group</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Enforcement</h4>
      <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at
        <a href="tel:+34605170745">+34 605 170 745</a> or <a href="mailto:soriano.nuria@gmail.com">soriano.nuria@gmail.com</a>.
        All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
        The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
        Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
      <p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
         determined by other members of the project's leadership.</p>
